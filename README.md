# opml2newpipe
Quick and dirty Python script I made to convert an .opml file exported from [Fraidycat](https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat) into a subscription list compatible with [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe).

## Service compatibility
This script is compatible with the following web services:
- Bandcamp
- Soundcloud
- Youtube

Any other websites that may be in the .opml file may be ignored.
